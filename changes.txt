Changes:
Used peristent volume claim for /data/db-users in user-db.yaml. Add securityContext to make it writeable
Redirect HTTP to HTTPS

TODO:
Read about readiness/liveness probes and apply them to the ingress container 
Use persistent volume claims for all persistent data
Add resource limits to all new pods (e.g. nginx pods for ingress)

Questions:
How would I do HA sessions? How would I make sure a session continued even if the session pod died
