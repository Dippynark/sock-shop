TODO:
Read about readiness/liveness probes and apply them to the ingress container 
Use persistent volume claims for all persistent data
Add resource limits to all new pods (e.g. nginx pods for ingress)
Add rediness/liveness probes to all pods
Deploy alerting
Autoscaling
Alert Manager
Configure proper kibana health checks (rather than just redirecting to grafana)
Make sure basic authentication uses HTTPS

Best Practices:
TODO:
liveness/readiness checks
persistent data
ensure there is never more than one deployment when there is only one 1 persistent volume claim
resource quotas
version every image
Add .spec.strategy.type==Recreate to all deployments

Questions:
How would I do HA sessions? How would I make sure a session continued even if the session pod died
Is it better to have one nginx deployment directing traffic to ingress or to have one container in each deployment pod
How can I do HTTP redirects and kibana health checks
Is the nginx basic auth served over HTTP or HTTPS
How con I configure readiness checks for kibana? It always returns 301
