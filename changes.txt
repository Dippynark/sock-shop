How would I do HA sessions? How would I make sure a session continued even if the session pod died
Is it better to have one nginx deployment directing traffic to ingress or to have one container in each deployment pod
How can I do HTTP redirects and kibana health checks
Is the nginx basic auth served over HTTP or HTTPS
How con I configure readiness checks for kibana? It always returns 301
What's the point on having initial delay for readiness probes
Why have you not put liveness probes on the kube-lego deployment?
